        <h2>Here is a block of text with poor contrast:</h2>
        <p>It is a period of civil war.<br/>
            Rebel spaceships, striking<br/>
            from a hidden base, have won<br/>
            their first victory against<br/>
            the evil Galactic Empire.<br/>
            <br/>
            During the battle, Rebel<br/>
            spies managed to steal secret<br/>
            plans to the Empire's<br/>
            ultimate weapon, the DEATH<br/>
            STAR, an armored space<br/>
            station with enough power to<br/>
            destroy an entire planet.<br/>
            <br/>
            Pursued by the Empire's<br/>
            sinister agents, Princess<br/>
            Leia races home aboard her<br/>
            starship, custodian of the<br/>
            stolen plans that can save<br/>
            her people and restore<br/>
            freedom to the galaxy.....</p>
