# Web Accessibility Test Website

## Description
A test website created to test our extension's improvements in accessibility. Note, we used [Microsoft's Automated Accessibility Testing](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) to quantitatively determine our extension's improvements. In the future, we'd like to integrate this program into a pipeline where our program consumes the results of the automated testing.
